# Ristiinopiskelupalvelu examples

This module contains a few Java examples on how to interact with the centralized service via JMS.

The module is a Spring Boot app so it is runnable easily, although it doesn't really do that much since it's meant as an example only :)

You need to have latest Maven and at least Java 11 installed in order to build and run it.

1) build: **mvn clean package**
2) run: **java -jar target/ristiinopiskelu-examples.jar** 

The example REST APIs are available under http://localhost:8080/examples/api/, check out the controllers for more info.
