# Note that this is supposed to be automated
# But for now migrations are ran by hand, instructions below

! Folders that contain reindex.json are the ones that contain some changes, but you are supposed to reindex all indices
! to new indices with current version numbering and swap alias to point for that index.

# Running version migrations by hand:

    1. Create new index with current version number eg.
    PUT /[indexname_v1.0.0]/
    {
        "mappings": [mapper.json here]
    }

    2. Reindex documents from latest version index to new index
    POST /_reindex
    {
        [reindex.json here]
    }

    3. Switch alias to point new index
    POST /_aliases
    {
        [alias.json here]
    }

# NOTE: Remember to create new history indices and make sure their mappers match new versions of original indices.
# No need to run reindex for history indices since we do not want to modify data. Just move aliases to point new history indices.
