# Ristiinopiskelupalvelu - Cross Institutional Study Service

Cross-Institutional Study Information Service is a centralised information sharing service for higher education institutions in Finland. The service lets higher education institutions exchange information on courses, registrations for courses and course assessment in a standardised format enabling cross-institutional studies and higher student mobility. The goal is to allow more flexibility and opportunities for students, to reduce overlap in teaching and to use teaching resources more effectively.
